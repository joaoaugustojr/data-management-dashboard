## 📊 Project Overview

This project is a **simple yet scalable dashboard** designed to manage a list of payments. It allows users to:

- Create, edit, and delete payment records  
- Filter results in real time with multiple combined conditions  
- Interact with a highly responsive and optimized frontend

To ensure performance and scalability, the system leverages **Redis for caching** and implements **frontend techniques** to reduce unnecessary API calls.

## 🔮 Future Plans

Planned enhancements include:

- A complete **admin dashboard** with authentication  
- Additional test coverage for new features and modules  
- **Scheduled tasks** to automatically update payment statuses based on due dates  
- Continuous improvements in **UX and UI navigation**
